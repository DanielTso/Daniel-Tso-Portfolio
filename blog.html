          <h2 class="blog-post__title">Why AI Won't Replace Construction Managers — But It Will Replace the Ones Who Ignore It</h2>
          <time class="blog-post__date" datetime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post__body">
          <p>Every few months someone sends me an article about how AI is going to eliminate construction jobs. I read the headline, look at who wrote it — usually someone who has never set foot on a job site — and move on. Because here's the thing: AI isn't going to replace construction managers. But it will absolutely replace the ones who refuse to learn it.</p>

          <p>I've been in construction for 33 years. I've watched the industry resist every wave of technology — from email to CAD to BIM. Every time, the reaction was the same: "That's not how we do things." And every time, the people who adapted early came out ahead. The ones who didn't got left behind or retired bitter about how the industry changed on them.</p>

          <p>AI is the biggest shift I've seen. Bigger than BIM. And I say that as someone who uses it every day — not as a novelty, but as a tool that makes me faster, more accurate, and more competitive.</p>

          <h3>The Real Threat Isn't the Technology</h3>

          <p>The construction industry is notoriously slow to adopt new technology. We still have superintendents who track schedules on legal pads. That's not a criticism — I've worked with some brilliant people who operate that way. But when you're managing a $60M project with 110 personnel, you need every advantage you can get.</p>

          <p>The real threat isn't that a machine is going to walk a job site and manage trades. That's science fiction. The real threat is the project manager down the road who uses AI to draft RFIs in minutes instead of hours, who runs spec analysis through a language model to catch conflicts before they become change orders, and who generates submittal packages while their competitors are still formatting Word documents.</p>

          <p>That PM is going to outperform you. Not because they're smarter. Because they're leveraging better tools.</p>

          <h3>Why Construction Needs Field-Experienced AI Users</h3>

          <p>Here's what the tech world gets wrong about construction AI: they think you can just drop a chatbot into a construction workflow and call it innovation. You can't. AI is only as good as the person prompting it, and prompting AI for construction work requires knowing construction.</p>

          <p>When I use AI to draft an RFI, I'm not typing "write an RFI." I'm feeding it the spec section, the drawing detail, the field condition, and the specific conflict — because I've seen that conflict before in the field. The AI writes it faster than I can type. But it writes it correctly because I know what to ask for.</p>

          <p>This is the gap the industry needs to fill. We don't need more tech people who've never touched a hammer trying to sell us software. We need field-experienced people who understand the technology. That combination is rare, and it's where the competitive advantage lives.</p>

          <h3>What I'm Actually Doing With AI</h3>

          <p>I got certified in AI Engineering not because it was trendy, but because I saw what it could do. Here's what I use it for right now:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>RFI generation from field observations — what used to take 45 minutes takes 10</li>
            <li>Spec and submittal review with automated conflict flagging</li>
            <li>Proposal drafting that pulls from project data and past performance</li>
            <li>Document analysis across hundreds of pages of specs and drawings</li>
            <li>Daily report summarization and trend analysis</li>
          </ul>

          <p>None of this replaces judgment. None of it replaces the ability to read a room, manage a crew, or make a call in the field when things go sideways. But it eliminates hours of administrative work that used to eat my evenings. That's not a threat — that's a gift.</p>

          <p>The construction managers who will thrive in the next decade are the ones learning these tools now. Not next year. Now. The rest will wonder what happened.</p>

          <h2 class="blog-post__title">Lessons from a $60M Project Turnaround</h2>
          <time class="blog-post__date" datetime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post__body">
          <p>In 2021, I walked onto a mining project that was bleeding money. The Mission Mine Mill Expansion — $60 million, 110 personnel, and completely off the rails. The previous leadership had been removed. The schedule was blown. Morale was in the dirt. I had 48 hours to figure out what was wrong and start fixing it.</p>

          <p>This wasn't my first troubled project. After 33 years in construction, you develop a sense for what's broken just by walking the site. But this one was different in scale. Everything was broken — communication, crew structure, material flow, accountability. It wasn't one problem. It was a system failure.</p>

          <h3>The First 48 Hours</h3>

          <p>When you take over a failing project, there's a temptation to do a deep audit. Pull every report, review every schedule, build a recovery plan in a conference room. That's the wrong move. The project is already behind — you don't have the luxury of a two-week assessment.</p>

          <p>Here's what I did in the first 48 hours:</p>

          <p><strong>One: I walked every inch of the site.</strong> Not with the foremen giving me a tour — alone. I needed to see the actual condition without anyone managing my perception. I looked at material staging, equipment utilization, work fronts, and crew deployment. Within four hours, I had a clear picture of where work was actually happening and where people were standing around waiting for direction.</p>

          <p><strong>Two: I held individual conversations with every foreman and lead.</strong> Not group meetings — one-on-one. I asked each of them the same three questions: What's your biggest obstacle right now? What do you need that you're not getting? Who on your crew is carrying the weight? Those conversations told me more in a day than a month of reports would have. I found out who knew what they were doing, who was checked out, and where the real bottlenecks were.</p>

          <p><strong>Three: I restructured the daily rhythm.</strong> I implemented a 6:00 AM foremen's meeting — 15 minutes, no chairs, standing only. Every foreman reports three things: what they completed yesterday, what they're doing today, and what's blocking them. No politics, no narratives. Just status. That meeting became the heartbeat of the project.</p>

          <h3>Fixing the Communication Breakdown</h3>

          <p>The single biggest problem on that project wasn't technical — it was communication. Crews didn't know what other crews were doing. Material wasn't staged where it needed to be because nobody was coordinating the logistics. RFIs were sitting unanswered because there was no tracking system anyone actually used.</p>

          <p>I established clear chains of communication with simple rules. Every RFI got a number and a 48-hour response deadline. Every material request went through a single point of contact. Every schedule update was posted physically on the job board — not buried in an email thread nobody reads.</p>

          <p>Within two weeks, the project started moving. Not because I'm some kind of genius — because the people on that site were capable. They just needed structure, accountability, and someone who would make a decision and own it.</p>

          <h3>What Separates Managers from Leaders in a Crisis</h3>

          <p>A manager tracks the schedule. A leader changes the trajectory. On a troubled project, the difference matters. Managers will tell you what went wrong and who's responsible. Leaders will tell you what's happening next and take ownership of the outcome.</p>

          <p>The Mission Mine project taught me something I already knew but hadn't articulated: people will run through walls for a leader who shows up, makes clear decisions, and doesn't blame them for the mess they inherited. I never once pointed fingers at the previous team. That serves no purpose. The crew didn't need to hear about what went wrong. They needed to see what right looks like.</p>

          <p>We brought that project to completion. Not on the original schedule — that was gone before I arrived. But we stabilized it, recovered what could be recovered, and delivered. The crew that was demoralized when I showed up was the same crew that finished the job. They just needed someone to lead them.</p>

          <p>Every troubled project I've been on has reinforced the same lesson: the problem is almost never the people. It's the system. Fix the system, and the people will perform.</p>

          <h2 class="blog-post__title">From Trades to Tech: A 33-Year Construction Career</h2>
          <time class="blog-post__date" datetime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post__body">
          <p>I started in construction the way a lot of people used to — working with family. Before I ever opened a textbook on construction management, I was carrying material, pulling wire, and learning how buildings actually go together. Not in a classroom. On a site. That foundation has shaped every decision I've made since.</p>

          <p>My grandfather was a tradesman. My uncles were in the trades. When I was old enough to be useful, I was put to work. Nobody asked me what my career goals were. They handed me tools and expected me to learn. And I did.</p>

          <h3>The Decision to Get the Degree</h3>

          <p>By my early twenties, I knew two things: I wanted to stay in construction, and I wanted to run projects, not just work on them. That meant getting a degree. I enrolled at Arizona State University and graduated in 1998 with a BS in Construction Management.</p>

          <p>Some people in the trades look down on the degree. Some people with degrees look down on the trades. Both are wrong. The best project managers I've ever worked with understand both worlds. They can read a P6 schedule and also tell you when a welder is running a bead wrong. The degree gave me the management tools. The trade experience gave me the credibility to use them.</p>

          <p>When I walked onto a Bechtel site for the first time, I wasn't some kid fresh out of college who'd never gotten his boots dirty. I was a tradesman with a degree. That combination opened doors that neither one alone would have.</p>

          <h3>Eleven Years at Bechtel</h3>

          <p>Bechtel is where I became a construction professional. Eleven years on massive projects — semiconductor plants, mining operations, power infrastructure. That's where I learned what large-scale project management actually looks like. Not the theory. The reality.</p>

          <p>I started as a Field Engineer and worked my way up to Construction Manager. Every role taught me something different. As a Field Engineer, I learned how to track progress and manage documentation. As a Superintendent, I learned how to manage people — real people, not org chart boxes. As a Construction Manager, I learned how to see the whole picture and make decisions that affected hundreds of workers and millions of dollars.</p>

          <p>Bechtel has a culture of discipline that's hard to find elsewhere. Everything is documented. Everything is procedural. Some people find that suffocating. I found it clarifying. When you're managing a project with thousands of moving parts, discipline is what keeps it together. I took that discipline with me when I left.</p>

          <h3>Why the Best PMs Have Swung a Hammer</h3>

          <p>Here's something I believe deeply: the best construction project managers are the ones who've worked in the field. Not because trade work makes you inherently better — but because it gives you something no MBA program can: empathy for the people doing the work and an understanding of what's actually possible.</p>

          <p>When a foreman tells me something can't be done in the timeframe I've scheduled, I know whether he's right. Not because I'm questioning his integrity — because I've done the work. I know how long it takes to rig a vessel, run process pipe, or set structural steel. That knowledge isn't theoretical for me. It's physical memory.</p>

          <p>That matters when you're making decisions under pressure. It matters when you're pushing a schedule. And it matters when you're earning the respect of a crew. Tradesmen know instantly whether their boss has ever gotten their hands dirty. You can't fake it.</p>

          <h3>How 33 Years Has Changed the Industry</h3>

          <p>When I started, we had paper blueprints, physical RFI logs, and face-to-face coordination meetings. Now we have BIM models, cloud-based project management, and AI tools that can analyze a spec book in minutes. The fundamental work hasn't changed — steel still gets welded, concrete still gets poured, and people still need leadership. But the tools have transformed how we plan, coordinate, and execute.</p>

          <p>The construction managers who will succeed going forward are the ones who bridge both worlds. Who can walk a site in the morning and optimize a BIM model in the afternoon. Who understand that technology serves the work — it doesn't replace it. That's the career I've built, and it's the advice I'd give to anyone starting out today: learn the trade first, then learn the technology. Not the other way around.</p>

          <h2 class="blog-post__title">The Digital Job Site: How I'm Using AI in Construction Today</h2>
          <time class="blog-post__date" datetime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-post__body">
          <p>This isn't an article about what AI might do for construction someday. This is about what I'm doing with it right now. Today. On active projects. The gap between what's possible and what most construction professionals are actually using is enormous — and that gap is an opportunity for anyone willing to close it.</p>

          <p>I got my AI Engineering certification because I saw the writing on the wall. Not the threat — the advantage. Every hour I spend learning these tools saves me ten hours in the field. That math is simple. Here's how it breaks down in practice.</p>

          <h3>RFI Generation from Field Observations</h3>

          <p>The traditional RFI workflow is painful. You identify a conflict in the field, go back to the trailer, pull up the drawings, cross-reference the specs, draft the RFI in whatever format the GC requires, and submit it. For a complex technical issue, that's 30 to 45 minutes per RFI. On a busy project, you might have five or six a week. That's half a day gone.</p>

          <p>Here's my workflow now: I document the field condition with photos and notes. I feed the relevant spec sections and drawing details into an AI model along with the field observation. The AI drafts the RFI in the correct format, citing the specific spec clauses and drawing references, and flags the conflict clearly. I review it, make any adjustments, and submit. Total time: 10 minutes. Same quality. Often better, because the AI catches cross-references I might have missed scanning through a 400-page spec book.</p>

          <h3>Automated Spec and Submittal Review</h3>

          <p>Submittals are the lifeblood of a construction project, and reviewing them against specs is tedious, detailed work. Miss a conflict and you've got a change order. Catch it early and you've saved the project money and time.</p>

          <p>I use AI to run first-pass reviews on submittals against project specifications. The model compares the submitted product data against the spec requirements and flags discrepancies — wrong material grade, insufficient capacity rating, missing test certifications. It doesn't replace my review. But it means when I sit down to do the final check, the obvious conflicts are already highlighted. I'm focused on judgment calls, not data comparison.</p>

          <h3>Proposal and Estimate Drafting</h3>

          <p>When I'm building a proposal for a new project or a change order, there's a lot of boilerplate that needs to be accurate but isn't a high-value use of my time. Scope descriptions, methodology sections, resource plans, safety narratives. AI handles the first draft by pulling from project data, past proposals, and standard methodologies. I refine the specifics, adjust for project conditions, and finalize. The output is professional, consistent, and produced in a fraction of the time.</p>

          <h3>BIM Coordination and Clash Detection</h3>

          <p>BIM coordination has always been a process of overlaying models and finding conflicts. What's changing is the intelligence layer on top of that process. AI-powered tools can now prioritize clashes by severity, suggest resolution sequences based on trade priority, and flag recurring conflict patterns that indicate a systemic design issue rather than an isolated clash.</p>

          <p>On my current project — BIM coordination for a mission-critical datacenter — this is directly applicable. When you're dealing with dozens of trades and thousands of potential clashes, having an intelligent filter that separates the critical from the noise is the difference between productive coordination meetings and ones that waste everyone's time.</p>

          <h3>Bridging the Gap</h3>

          <p>Here's what I've learned about bringing AI into construction: you can't lead with the technology. You have to lead with the problem. Nobody on a job site cares that you're using a large language model. They care that RFIs are going out faster, submittals aren't sitting in a queue for two weeks, and coordination meetings actually resolve issues.</p>

          <p>The gap between tech companies and construction is cultural, not technical. The tools exist. What's missing is people who speak both languages — who understand construction workflows deeply enough to apply AI where it actually matters, and who can demonstrate value without the jargon.</p>

          <p>That's the role I'm filling. Not as a tech evangelist. As a construction professional who happens to understand the technology. The digital job site isn't coming someday. It's here. The question is whether you're using it or watching someone else use it to outperform you.</p>
